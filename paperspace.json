                "description": "Will you break more things? Break bigger things? Are you willing to break the thing that nobody wants you to break?”... “As it turns out, nobody wants you to break the system itself.” Fictional billionaire character Miles Bron of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022) discusses the idea of breaking systems and how his close group of friends are “disruptors” of the system. In the solving of a murder that occurs while the group are hosted by Miles Bron on his private island, the movie comments on current social systems using the characters’ differing social and wealth standings."

It consists of expansive shots of urban life and natural landscapes juxtaposed with an experimental score composed by Philip Glass. The film seeks to display modern life in a way different to that which we experience it; zooming out to display the systems and connections which govern our actions."
