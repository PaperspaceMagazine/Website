# Website
Welcome to Paperspace Website Repository!

To edit the website and add new content, edit the Public/Paperspace.json file.

A few things about json: 
* The order matters so take care where you append new files to. 
* Insert '<br>' for newline and '<br><br>' for new paragraph.

Images should be added to the Public/images folder, please then link it with the corresponding image path in the json.

If you are unsure how things work, send me an email on me@willpowell.uk
