# Website
Welcome to Paperspace Website Repository!

To edit the website and add new content, edit the Public/Paperspace.json file.

A few things about json: 
* The order matters so take care where you append new files to. 
* To create a new paragraph or line use the [br tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp).

Images should be added to the Public/images folder, please then link it with the corresponding image path in the json.

If you are unsure how things work, send me an email on me@willpowell.uk
